- ✅ Handling missing values with median imputation
- 📐 Creating new features like `profit` and `profit_per_employee`
- ⚖️ Scaling numerical data using StandardScaler
- 🧠 Encoding categorical data for ML-readiness
- 📊 Drawing insights from visualizations (e.g., revenue vs. profit)



 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Google Colab (for development)
- PowerPoint (for final presentation)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
